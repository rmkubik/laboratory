# My Laboratory

I've been struggling to finish projects over the last few years. It has weighed on me to not "ship" them in anyway. I made this place as a space where I can ship unfinished projects instead of letting them languish forever.

I'm calling this space a laboratory for now. Most of these projects are experiments of sorts. Or they're explorations of ideas. Lab doesn't feel quite right to me, but its good enough for now.
