- [Ryan Kubik's Static Site Generator](https://github.com/rmkubik/rk-ssg)

The idea of this project is to build a static site generator specifically only for my own purposes. I liked this article from a friend on the subject and it inspired this project.

I went and overcomplicated this project, but I had fun doing so. I learned a lot more about how some of these tools work so that has been nice too.

## 2/8/26

I'd like to replace the Next.js site that I run on my personal site, [ryankubik.com](https://ryankubik.com/). It's okay for blog posts, but it feels overcomplicated to me now. It is also frustrating to try and put anything non-React into my site. I'm not sure when I'll get around to migrating everything over.

I'm using this generator to build my laboratory site now. I didn't have a use case for it when I built it over the holiday break.
